* Ideas to be considered
   
** SOM specification 
   - Lems "regimes" should be incorporated as a list of "dynamics"
     elements, instead of inside events[dynamics]. This way, all
     regimes will be treated equally.
   - network (i.e. populations + connections) specification. Notice
     that event handling for pops. can be complicated (see Brette's
     paper http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio.NC/0611089, Neuron
     http://www.neuron.yale.edu/hg/neuron/nrn/file/0fe62e501b97/src/nrncvode
     )
 
 
** common integrator features 
   - non-negativivity of gating vars/ concentrations must be taken
     into account by ode solvers
   - extend solution or restart solvers: check numerics/cvode event
