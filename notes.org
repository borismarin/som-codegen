* Ideas to be considered
  
** ECO specification
   - the connectivity matrix is sparse. Writing it explicitly is
   definetely not the best representation. A list of i->j connections
   would be the obvious solution.
   - dealing with elements whose dynamics are not defined in terms of
   differential equations. External inputs must be automatically
   interpolated.
   
 
** common integrator features 
   - non-negativivity of gating vars/ concentrations must be taken
     into account by ode solvers
   - extend solution or restart solvers: check numerics/cvode event
